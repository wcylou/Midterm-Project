#### Blindr is a Full Stack Web Application that simulates a dating site.

### Overview
- The application contains an original MySQL database schema with multiple cross-linked tables.
- The data is accessed using Java entities created/annotated with JPA. Users can create, update, and delete records in the application using specific permissions governed by their profile in HttpSession.
- The site tracks user activity and presents contextual menus and options based on their profile.  
- We use a Tomcat server running on the Amazon Web Services platform to host the application.

### Technologies/Tools Used
* Java
* Gradle
* Spring Tool Suite
* Hibernate
* HTML
* CSS (Bootstrap)
* JavaScript and jQuery
* MySQL
* GitHub
* Amazon Web Services

### How to Run
- Upon loading, the user is prompted to Register and creates their own user name and password.
- The user is then able to create a profile, similar to those on a dating site and then can view their "matches" which are other profiles in the system.
- Upon choosing a match, the application assigns an event based on the interests selected in the two profiles. The user can then send and receive messages from their matches which are displayed in their inbox.
